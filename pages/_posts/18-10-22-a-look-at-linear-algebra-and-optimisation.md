title: A Look at Linear Algebra and Optimisation

Over the next month or two I'll try and post notes for the course "Linear Algebra and Optimisation" at the IT University of Copenhagen. While I didn't take the course myself, because I got merit for another linear algebra course, I did help a few of my classmates when they were taking it, and I'm also currently TAing the course for the new students.

My motivation for this is threefold:

1) The data science programme is mathematically heavy, and as such it needs a thorough foundation. Most, if not all, other math-heavy programmes in Denmark have an introductory math course. Ordinary concepts introduced by these courses include complex numbers, sequences and series, simple differential equations, Taylor's theorem, etc., which are not necessarily important concepts to grasp as a data scientist. However, these courses also serve the purpose of introducing students to rigour in math, as well as refresh some basic math that students might not have messed around with for years. LinAlgOp (as I will refer to it from now on) skips these less important concepts, and instead attempts to bunch together linear algebra and real analysis into one introductory math course. The idea is interesting, but in my opinion unrealistic. Linear algebra is troublesome for most as it is. Making it the first math course in the programme won't help.

2) The entire programme is chaotic due to its recent kickoff last year, when I started. After the first year, we had already lost half of the people who started. The reason? LinAlgOp and statistics. This is evident from the grades, which I will not reveal. Two quite extensive math courses on the first year with no introduction to math takes its toll. So because of the high level of difficulty and the intrinsic chaos present on a new programme, I feel that it's only reasonable to help one another - especially considering the importance of linear algebra in data science.

3) Linear algebra is interesting and exciting, yet it's often taught with long dull calculations instead of the intuitive underlying theory.


As of writing this, the course has run twice, and the latest version can be found [here](https://mit.itu.dk/ucs/cb_www/course.sml?course_id=2013608&mode=search&lang=da&print_friendly_p=t&goto=1540218458.000){:target="_blank"}.
