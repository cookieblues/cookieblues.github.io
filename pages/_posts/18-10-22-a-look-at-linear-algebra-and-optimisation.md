title: A Look at Linear Algebra and Optimisation

Over the next month or two I'll try and post notes for the course "Linear Algebra and Optimisation" at the IT University of Copenhagen. While I didn't take the course myself, because I got merit for another linear algebra course, I did help a few of my classmates when they were taking it, and I'm also currently TAing the course for the new students.

My motivation for this is threefold:

1) The data science programme is mathematically heavy with network analysis, algorithms and data structures, and machine learning as courses on the menu.
 As such, a solid mathematical foundation is required. Most, if not all, other mathematically inclined programmes in Denmark have an introductory math course: mathematics and physics at KU have introduction to mathematics[^1][^2], computer science at KU has discrete mathematics[^3], and the engineers at DTU all have to take an extensive introductory mathematics course[^4]. Ordinary concepts introduced by these courses include complex numbers, sequences and series, simple differential equations, Taylor's theorem, etc., which are not necessarily important concepts to grasp as a data scientist.\\
 Yet, these courses also serve the purpose of introducing students to rigour in mathematics, as well as refresh some elementary mathematics that students might not have seen for years. LinAlgOp (as I will refer to it from now on) skips the previous lesser important concepts, and instead attempts to bunch together linear algebra and real analysis into one introductory mathematics course. The idea is interesting, but in my opinion unrealistic. Linear algebra is troublesome for most as it is. Making it the first mathematics course in the programme won't help.

2) The entire programme is chaotic due to its recent kickoff last year, when I started. After the first year, we had already lost half of the people who started. The reason? LinAlgOp and statistics. This is evident from the grades, which I will not reveal. Two quite extensive mathematics courses on the first year with no introduction to mathematics takes its toll. So because of the high level of difficulty and the intrinsic chaos present on a new programme, I feel that it's only reasonable to help one another - especially considering the importance of linear algebra in data science.

3) Linear algebra is interesting and exciting, yet it's often taught with long dull calculations instead of the intuitive underlying theory. Besides, I've taught linear algebra before, and it probably won't be the last time, so having some online notes to reference might save me some time.


As of writing this, the course has run twice, and the latest version can be found [here](https://mit.itu.dk/ucs/cb_www/course.sml?course_id=2013608&mode=search&lang=da&print_friendly_p=t&goto=1540218458.000){:target="_blank"}.
