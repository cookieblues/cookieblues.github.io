With the recent release of [Classic World of Wacraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/wowclassic){:target="_blank"} and my unfortunate lack of time to play it, I thought about how I could spend some time on it. I played on a few private servers on a decent level, and I was always interested in 'minmaxing' (minimizing weakness and maximizing strengths), i.e. pushing the limit of capability of your character. Since I cannot play the game these days, I rely on getting my information elsewhere, but hopefully someone can correct my me, if something isn't correct. I will also start with the Holy Paladin, since that is what I 'mained', but I could see myself diving into any class and specialization in the future.

### Attribute overview
There are exactly $6$ **attributes** or **stats** (short for statistics) that are relevant to the Holy Paladin. These are: mana, intellect (int), spirit, healing power (+healing), mana per five seconds (mp5), and spell critical chance (spell crit). Three of these are **secondary stats** (+healing, mp5, and spell crit), which means they are influenced by the primary stats (intellect and spirit). Mana falls outside the definitions of primary and secondary stats, and I think the best definition of it would be to call it a **reserve**, i.e. health, mana, rage, and energy are reserves.

#### Mana
As mentioned, mana is a reserve that you spend to cast spells. It follows that the more mana you have, the more spells you will be able to cast, before you exhaust your reserve.
The base mana of a level $60$ human Paladin is $1232$, plus an additional $1050$ mana from base intellect. This come out to be $2282$, which is the amount of mana a level $60$ human Paladin has without wearing any armour.

#### Intellect
Intellect is advertised as the primary stat for spellcasters considering its benefits, and is therefore an important one to look into as the role of a healer. Intellect gives a bonus to mana as well as spell crit. At level $60$ each point of intellect provides $15$ mana, and a bit of spell crit (which we will discuss in a bit). The base intellect of a level $60$ human Paladin is $70$, which is where the $1050 = 70 \times 15$ extra base mana comes from.

#### Spirit
Spirit is the primary stat for regenerating mana. The more spirit, the faster you regenerate mana. **HOW MUCH FASTER** The base spirit of a level 60 human Paladin is 78 before the racial is added.
