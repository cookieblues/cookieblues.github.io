As mentioned in <a href="{{ site.url }}/pages/bsmalea-notes-1a">notes 1a</a>, in classification the possible values for the target variables are discrete, and we call them classes.

Before we mapped input variables to real target variables. In classification the goal is to map input variables to discrete target variables.



### Overview of linear classifiers

Distribution-free classifiers
simply assign input variables to classes.

Discriminative classifiers
are models of the conditional probability distribution of the target variables given the input variables.

Generative classifiers
are models of the joint probability distribution of the targets and input variables.
