I"4<p>This hopefully won’t take as long as my notes on <a href="http://localhost:4000/linear_algebra_and_optimisation">Linear Algebra and Optimization</a>, but I will start writing up my notes for the course “<a href="https://mit.itu.dk/ucs/cb_www/course.sml?course_id=2013612&amp;mode=search&amp;lang=en&amp;print_friendly_p=t&amp;goto=1542111182.000" target="_blank">Machine Learning</a>” at the <a href="https://www.itu.dk/" target="_blank">IT University of Copenhangen</a>. My goal is as always to explain the intuition behind the introduced concepts, making it easier to understand and engage with. I believe this can help the few who struggle to understand the concepts, as well as found the concepts for those who know how to employ them but lack the why.</p>

<p>If you click the link above, you’ll see that there are four intended learning outcomes for the course; the student should be able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Discuss</strong>, clearly <strong>explain</strong>, and <strong>reflect</strong> upon central machine learning concepts and algorithms.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose among</strong> and <strong>make use</strong> of the most important machine learning approaches in order to apply (match) them to practical problems.</li>
  <li><strong>Implement</strong> abstractly specified machine learning methods in an imperative programming language.</li>
  <li><strong>Combine</strong> and <strong>modify</strong> machine learning methods to <strong>analyse</strong> practical dataset and <strong>convey</strong> the results.</li>
</ul>
