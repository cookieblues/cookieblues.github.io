I"Û<p>As mentioned in <a href="http://localhost:4000/guides/2021/03/08/bsmalea-notes-1a">notes 1a</a>, in classification the possible values for the target variables are discrete, and we call these possible values ‚Äúclasses‚Äù. In <a href="http://localhost:4000/guides/2021/03/22/bsmalea-notes-2">notes 2</a> we went through regression, which in short refers to constructing a function $h( \mathbf{x} )$ from a dataset $\mathbf{X} = \left( (\mathbf{x}_1, t_1), \dots, (\mathbf{x}_N, t_N) \right)$ that yields prediction values $t$ for new values of $\mathbf{x}$. The objective in classification is the same, except the values of $t$ are discrete.</p>

<p>We are going to cover 3 different approaches or types of classifiers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generative classifiers</strong> that model the joint probability distribution of the input and target variables $p(\mathbf{x}, t)$.</li>
  <li><strong>Discriminative classifiers</strong> that model the conditional probability distribution of the target given an input variable $p(t | \mathbf{x})$.</li>
  <li><strong>Distribution-free classifiers</strong> that do not use a probability model but directly assign input to target variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick disclaimer for this topic: <strong>the terminology will be very confusing</strong>, but we‚Äôll deal with that when we cross those bridges.</p>

<p>So, they all do the same thing (classification). Which one is the best? Which one should I use?</p>
