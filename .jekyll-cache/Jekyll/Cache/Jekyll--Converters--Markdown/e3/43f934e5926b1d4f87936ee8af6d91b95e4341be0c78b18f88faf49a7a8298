I"—<p>Imagine you‚Äôre participating in a $100$ metres sprint race. When you hear the starter‚Äôs pistol, you accelerate for dozens of metres, i.e. your velocity will increase until you reach your maximum speed. Let‚Äôs assume, you reach your maximum speed $5$ seconds into the race, after which you start to fatigue and decelerate - and let‚Äôs also assume, you finish the race in $10$ seconds. If we let $s(t)$ be the distance you‚Äôve traveled at time $t$, and $v(t)$ your velocity at time $t$, then we can draw your velocity and the distance you‚Äôve traveled in a plot like the one below.</p>

<p>Notice how towards the middle of the race you‚Äôre traveling more metres per unit of time than at the beginning and end. We know that to calculate velocity, we take the ratio of the distance traveled and the time it took. If we start at $s(t_1)$ and end at $s(t_2)$, we say</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{\text{average}} = \frac{s(t_2)-s(t_1)}{t_2-t_1}.</script>

<p>We can write this more formally as the average velocity from $t_1$ to some amount of time after that, if we use the time difference $t_2-t_1=\Delta t$. This gives us</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v_{\text{average}} = \frac{s(t_1 + \Delta t)-s(t_1)}{\Delta t}. \quad \quad (1)</script>

<p>This is a <em>change</em> in distance divided by a <em>change</em> in time, but if we were to ask, how fast you were running at an instant, the question doesn‚Äôt seem to make sense. No distance is traveled in a point in time, and no time has passed in an instant. Yet, in the plot above we have a function $v(t)$ that supposedly gives us the velocity at a point in time. The function gives us the <em>instantaneous</em> rate of <em>change</em> of distance.</p>

<h3 id="approach-and-limits">Approach and limits</h3>
<p>To understand this phenomenon of change in an instant, we have to talk about the concept of approach. Let‚Äôs look at the function $f(x) = x^2+1$. Imagine we had to figure out what $f(0)$ is equal to, without inserting $0$ into the function. One way of doing it could be to start from a number higher than $0$, say $1$, evalute the function at that number $f(1)=1^2+1=2$, then divide the number we just evaluated with, and repeat the process. This would give us the sequence: $f(1)=2$, $f(0.5)=1.7$, $f(0.25)=1.5$, $f(0.125)=1.35$, and so on. The same sequence would appear, if we started from values lower than $0$. Now, we know the answer is $f(0)=1$, but our argument isn‚Äôt very convincing. We want to be able to pick a number for $x$ close to $0$, that can get us arbitrarily close to $1$. This means that for any value $c$ close to $1$, we must be able to pick a value $x_c$ close to $0$ that satisfies $|1-f(x_c)|&lt;|1-c|$. If we can be certain about this, then we can say that $f(x)$ approaches $1$<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. We can certainly do this! Let‚Äôs say $c=1.01$, then we solve</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= 1.01 \\
x^2 + 1 &= 1.01 \\
x &= \sqrt{1.01-1} \\
x &= \pm 0.1
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>and pick a value of $x$ between $-0.1$ and $0.1$. We can generalize this such that for a given $c$, we pick $x$ to be between $-\sqrt{c-1}$ and $\sqrt{c-1}$. The key thing here is, if we want to say that a function approaches a value, then we have to be able to get <em>arbitrarily</em> close to it - and this has to be the case, if we‚Äôre approaching from either side of $x_c$.</p>

<p>This is the concept of approach and the intuition behind limits. Suppose $f(x)$ is defined for all $x$ around $a$ but not necessarily at $a$. We can say</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lim_{x \to x_c} f(x) = c, \quad \quad (2)</script>

<p>if we can make $f(x)$ get arbitrarily close to $c$ for values of $x$ close but not equal to $x_c$. Equation $(2)$ is read: ‚Äúthe limit of $f$ of $x$ as $x$ approaches $x_c$ equals $c$‚Äù. Another way to write this is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">f(x) \to c \quad \text{as} \quad x \to x_c,</script>

<p>which is read: ‚Äú$f$ of $x$ approaches $c$ as $x$ approaches $x_c$‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example:</h4>
<p>Suppose we have to find the limit</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1-\sqrt{x}}{1-x}.</script>

<p>The problem here is that we cannot insert $x=1$ into the fraction, as we would then divide by $0$. Instead, we do a bit of algebraic manipulation to get a limit, we can evaluate</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1-\sqrt{x}}{1-x}
&= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1-\sqrt{x}}{(1-\sqrt{x})(1+\sqrt{x})} \\
&= \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{x}} \\
&= \frac{1}{1+\sqrt{1}} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}.
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<h3 id="derivatives">Derivatives</h3>
<p>If we return to our initial example of the sprint race, we asked ourselves: how fast were you running at a point in time? With our new knowledge of approach and limits, we can rephrase the question and instead ask: what happens when $\Delta t$ approaches $0$ in equation $(1)$? The question asks, what</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">v(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{s(t+\Delta t)-s(t)}{\Delta t} \quad \quad (3)</script>

<p>is equal to. Underneath is an illustration of $v(t)$ as $\Delta t \to 0$.</p>

</video>

<p>As can be seen above, the velocity turns out to be the slope or tangent line of the distance. This is also what we call the derivative of the distance function. This is usually denoted</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{d}{dt}s(t) = v(t),</script>

<p>where $\frac{d}{dt}$ is the differentiation operator; differentiation is the process of finding a derivative. Using the common notation $y=f(x)$ to show that the independent (free) variable is $x$, and the dependent variable is $y$, we can write up several notations for the derivative:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{df}{dx} = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) = f'(x) = y' = Df(x) = D_x f(x).</script>

<h4 id="example-1">Example:</h4>
<p>Let $f(x) = x + \frac{1}{x}$, and let‚Äôs try and find the derivative using the definition from $(3)$. We see</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
f'(x)
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{x+\Delta x + \frac{1}{x + \Delta x} - \left( x + \frac{1}{x} \right)}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{\Delta x + \frac{1}{x + \Delta x} - \frac{1}{x}}{\Delta x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 1 + \frac{x - (x + \Delta x)}{\Delta x (x + \Delta x)x} \\
&= \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} 1 - \frac{1}{(x + \Delta x)x} \\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{x^2},
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>which is the actual derivative.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>One of my professors once said: ‚Äúdifferentiation is mechanics and integration is art‚Äù. At first it just sounded like a crap quote, but it‚Äôs more of a general saying than a quote really. Differentiation is mostly tedious calculation, and you just have to practice it a lot to learn it. However, integration often requires some creativity, but we‚Äôll get to that later on. I‚Äôm considering uploading a few exercises after this first week of calculus that try and teach some core tips and tricks of differentiation and integration.</p>
