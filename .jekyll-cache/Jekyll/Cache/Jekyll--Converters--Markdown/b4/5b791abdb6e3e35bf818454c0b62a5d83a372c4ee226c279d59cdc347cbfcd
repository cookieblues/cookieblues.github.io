I"Ï<p>A friend of mine recently asked me about word embeddings and similarity. I remember, I learned that the typical way of calculating the similarity between a pair of word embeddings is to take the cosine of the angle between their vectors. This measure of similarity makes sense due to the way that these word embeddings are commonly constructed, where each dimension is supposed to represent some sort of semantic meaning<span class="marginnote">These methods obviously have flaws, such as words that are spelled the same way but have different meanings (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph">homographs</a>), or sarcasm which often times is saying one thing but meaning the opposite.</span>.</p>
