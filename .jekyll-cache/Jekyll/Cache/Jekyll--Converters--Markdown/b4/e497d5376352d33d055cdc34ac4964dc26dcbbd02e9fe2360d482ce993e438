I"¢<p>A few people have been asking for a short guide to LaTeX, but since I donâ€™t have that much time on my hands these days, I thought Iâ€™d start with a very short guide that I can expand if needed.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>You can think of LaTeX as a programming language for documents. Itâ€™s well-suited for large projects and complicated document structures, as it keeps track of a bunch of things by itself (we wonâ€™t get into those things in this post though). The other huge plus for LaTeX is the ability to write complicated mathematical equations simple and beautiful.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started-with-overleaf">Getting started with Overleaf</h3>
<p>While itâ€™s possible to install LaTeX and a LaTeX editor on your computer, I think using Overleaf (version 2) is the best choice for most; you wonâ€™t have to find a proper LaTeX installation, worry about a million LaTeX files, deal with packages, figure out how to collaborate with other people, or worry about having access to your documents on different computers.<br />
Firstly, go to <a href="https://www.overleaf.com?r=094710d5&amp;rm=d&amp;rs=b" target="_blank">this link</a> (this is a referral link that gives me a few bonuses on Overleaf - it wonâ€™t have any affect on you, but if you prefer not to use this, then go to Google and search for Overleaf v2) and sign up for an Overleaf (version 2) account. Secondly, go back to Overleaf and log in. Thirdly, you should see a green button in the top left that says â€œNew Projectâ€. Click the button and choose â€œBlank Projectâ€. It will ask you to name your project, which can be whatever you want (it can be changed later if needed), and then press â€œCreateâ€.</p>
