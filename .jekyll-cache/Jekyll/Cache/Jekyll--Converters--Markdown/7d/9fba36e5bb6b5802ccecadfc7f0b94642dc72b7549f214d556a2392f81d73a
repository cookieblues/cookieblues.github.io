I"‹<p>Sometimes I find myself needing a specific 4-cost champion at level 8, and I wonder if itâ€™s worth rolling down to find it. Yet, it depends on how much gold I need to spend on rolling. If itâ€™s just 10 gold, then Iâ€™ll probably be inclined to do it no matter what, but if itâ€™s 40 gold, then I might be more hesitant and dependent on other factors, e.g. health or opponentsâ€™ board.</p>
