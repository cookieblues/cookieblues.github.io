<p>I recently participated in a challenge orchestrated by <a href="https://omdena.com/">Omdena</a>, which (if you don’t already know) is an international hub for AI enthusiasts that want to leverage AI solutions to solve some of humanity’s problems. The challenge was posed by a Nigerian NGO called RA365, and if you want to read more about it, Omdena asked me to write a small article for their blog regarding some work I did in the challenge. I didn’t really do much AI, so I decided to write about just that!</p>
