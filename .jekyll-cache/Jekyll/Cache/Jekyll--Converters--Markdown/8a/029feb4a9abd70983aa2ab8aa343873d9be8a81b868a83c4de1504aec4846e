I"“<p>Now we know a bit about machine learning: it involves models. Machine learning attempts to model data in order to make predictions about the data. In the <a href="http://localhost:4000/bsmalea-notes-1a">previous post</a> we dove into the inner functions of a model, and that is very much what machine learning is about. Yet, itâ€™s only half of it, really. The other half has to do with the concept of prediction, and how we make sure our models predict well. This course doesnâ€™t dabble that deep into this other half - but there are a few important topics in this regard that you should be aware of, as they pop up in machine learning all the time.</p>
