I"³<p>If you want to work with arrays in Python, you use NumPy. If you want to work with tabular data, you use Pandas. The quintessential Python library for data visualization is Matplotlib. Itâ€™s easy to use, flexible, and a lot of other visualization libraries build on the shoulders of Matplotlib. This means that learning Matplotlib will make it easier to understand and work with some of the more fancy visualization libraries.</p>
