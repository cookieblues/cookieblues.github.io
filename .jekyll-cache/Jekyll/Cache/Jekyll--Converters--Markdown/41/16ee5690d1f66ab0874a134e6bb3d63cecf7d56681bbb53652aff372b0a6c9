I"q<p>I just watched k3soju get a 2-star Jhin at level 5. You can watch the vod <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/852660769">here</a>. He gets to hit five shops before he has the 2-star Jhin. He sees the shops at 3:37:55, 3:39:00, 3:40:15, 3:41:04, and 3:42:18, where he hits a Jhin on the 2nd, 4th, and 5th shop. The chat immediately tried figuring out the probability, but as k3soju mentions, itâ€™s a bit complicated to figure out - and technically impossible without knowing everything that the 7 other players got as well. However, with a few reasonable assumptions, I think, we can come up with a decent estimate.</p>
