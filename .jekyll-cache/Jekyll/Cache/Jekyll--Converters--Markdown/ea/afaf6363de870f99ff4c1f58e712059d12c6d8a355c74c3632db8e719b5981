<p>It seems, most people derive their definition of machine learning from a quote from Arthur Lee Samuel in 1959: â€œProgramming computers to learn from experience should eventually eliminate the need for much of this detailed programming effort.â€ The interpretation to take away from this is that â€œmachine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.â€</p>

<p>While Arthur Lee Samuel first coined the term â€œmachine learningâ€ in 1959<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, the methods applied in machine learning come way before, e.g. the method of least-squares was first published by A. M. Legendre in 1805<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>, and Bayesâ€™ theorem, which is the cornerstone of Bayesian statistics, was first underpinned by Thomas Bayes in 1763<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. In the next post, weâ€™ll see the importance of Bayesâ€™ theorem in machine learning, when we dive into frequentism and Bayesianism.</p>

INSERT TIMELINE
-->

<p>Machine learning draws a lot of its methods from statistics, but there is a distinctive difference between the two areas: <strong>statistics is mainly concerned with estimation</strong>, whereas <strong>machine learning is mainly concerned with prediction</strong>. This distinction makes for great differences, as we will see soon enough.</p>

<p>There are many different machine learning methods that solve different tasks. This course presupposes two fundamental ones; <strong>supervised</strong> learning and <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning. These are further divided into two smaller categories as shown in the image underneath.</p>
